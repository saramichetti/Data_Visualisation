# Data_Visualisation

Two Projects developed for this course.
1. Spotify in the UK: did Covid change the way people listen to music? It's a poster that explains the figures for 2020, specifically the top 200 charts for the UK.
Data was downloaded from https://spotifycharts.com/regional and using the Spotify Web API spotipy
2. Interactive Dashboard: FIFA21 players analysis created in Power BI
